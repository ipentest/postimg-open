# postimg-open
Postimage.org is a free image uploader... It's pretty nice to upload and maintain pics that you want to send to others... 
Say bug bounty emails etc etc... However maintenance is a snag. Postimage expects you/anyone to visit their site once in every 6 months at least... 
So once you have a huge set of images, it's pretty cumbersome to do so... 
This is where the script comes in... It opens the images in a headless browser
